## NASA // SpaceX

🚀SpaceX🚀

- Donald J. Trump saw the potential, the *necessity*, of spacefaring independence.
  - He saw the need for a private, space agency. 
    - To, compliment our great public *research* focused NASA.
    - Who already has provably "launched" mankind into our current information age.
  - Another agency: 
    - One which can remain focused on practical launches.
    - Unhindered by Congress's budget cuts.
  - Allowing NASA: 
    - To, stay an appropriate size, to **focus** on research.
    - Now, NASA can look to the future. Measuring projects, in decades not in years. 
    - Sans the bloated organizational scaling. Which threatened **research** in the past.
  - This is the potential Donald J. Trump saw in SpaceX. 
    - SpaceX's revolutionary re-entry technology,
    - Its key to our imminent **Mars** exploration. 
- So, Donald J. Trump quickly moved: 
  - To, ensure SpaceX's allegiance to the United States of America.  
  - Its access to the American people.
  - Its share in the future prosperity of our nation.
