Mod Meeting


Focuses:


1) TDS Flairs, shadowbans, and auto-deletes

TDS Flairs are now full-scale shadowbans.  We also have a bot made by captainmeta which will remove all their posts upon flairing TDS, to save you moderation work and better keep the subreddit clean. 



2) Voter Fraud Flair Filter and Information

https://www.reddit.com/r/DonaldTrump/search?q=flair_name%3A%22%F0%9F%97%B3%EF%B8%8F+VOTER+FRAUD+%F0%9F%9A%AB%22

We are trying to make our subreddit hyper-informative for the upcoming fight.  As such, we have set up a Voter Fraud Flair Filter page that we now link on our sidebar, menu, automod sticky comment, and in our MAGAThreads.  Top mods will curate this list down to the most informative posts, moving other less informative things over to "Stop The Steal".

When you are approving /new/ posts, be sure to check the flairs.  If they are informative about voter fraud and dont have a flair, please flair them up.  Top mods can then later go in and decide if it is "Voter Fraud" or "Stop The Steal"... But if they go un-flaired all-together, the post might never find our Voter Fraud pahe.

Also please make sure we have any/all news you hear about.  We have to fight the censorship and make sure we have EVERYTHING up, even if it is a repost.



3) Our Election Map

https://www.reddit.com/r/donaldtrump/comments/jv9d98/official_rdonaldtrump_election_status/

By keeping the map as our primary sticky, we are reminding our community that the fight is still ongoing, lifting their spirits and energy.

Is there any thoughts on what can be added to this 'feature'/post to make it more informative?



4) State Contact Info Pages

https://www.reddit.com/r/donaldtrump/wiki/election_defense

We have a list of state contacts, as well as brief information on what our community can say to their local reps and officials.

If anyone would like to add contact information to these lists, or suggest additions/alterations to the information, please feel free to get with myself or kekistani



5) Our Election Defense Task Force posts

https://www.reddit.com/r/donaldtrump/comments/jv9eoz/magathread_election_defense_task_force_contact/

We will be using MAGAThreads to rally our community with a little more focus, not only reminding them of the contact information above, but also sending them to new media outlets, reminding them to flood existing social media in this time of censorship, and more.  We will also be adding p[rotests/rallies to these as well.

Are there any things we should be adding to this MAGAThread feature?

      On point 
      ```
      No. 4
      ```

      There's going to be down ballot + other elections. Upcoming in many states. 

      We should get together and finalize the states pages, individually. 

      Ensuring no election commissioner is being replaced. Within the next few weeks. 

      Ie, their contact info requires replacement. In the same timeframe.

      I'll check over Louisiana in the next week~. And, see if I can make a template. 

      But, it may be a restricted time window. For the other actually egregious states. 

      So, we might want to get the whole team on that. To at least check on a tertiary level.

      State pages have been changed to contact pages for the Election Defense Task Force... but the wiki history has the old versions for copy/pasta

      Ye the,

      https://www.sos.la.gov/OurOffice/ContactUs/Pages/default.aspx
      ```
      Definitely works for LA's case. B/c the contact info is actually always updated in our case.

      I don't really have much faith in that for, "other". More so communist run. 

      State's "official" election "contact" dot asp pages.
```

```md
    [10:22 PM] GuthixIsBalance: 
      If at all possible we should try to pull from an federal source. 

      Just to maintain future backwards compat.
